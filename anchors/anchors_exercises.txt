1. /^The\b/

The caret anchors the match to the beginning of the line, and the \b delineates a word boundary so that matches won't be made in the middle of a word.

2. /\bcat$/

Again, the \b is a word boundary so that only 'cat' as its own word will be matched. The $ anchors the match to the end of the line.

3. /\b[a-z][a-z][a-z]\b/i

4. /^(A|The) [A-Za-z][A-Za-z][A-Za-z][A-Za-z] (dog|cat)$
